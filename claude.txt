- 'virtual-scrolling-chat' branch has good progress

- Aug 6 morning build with comment "fixed build errors" was working fine before pdf optimisation

- page count is showing 1 page in DB. 

- left side bar list is not updating because of cache and many times it start loading. it shouldn't load after few change between pdf. 

- if one user is access another user pdf we'll show some other message.

- no message before summary first we'll send summary otherwise sometimes user asking about summary before DB saved all the chunks and this is creating trouble! 

- chat again loading from start and scrolling to down!  >> DONE

- pdf is not uploading from live website if not there in local webiste. 

- highlights sometimes working only on top and bottom line!

- difference between message gone! and 1st message shouldn't run any animation, opacity animation is running while sending message also. infact it's running that time only not on load. >> DONE

- on deleting text it's working but also showing some error need to fix that. 

- when i asked this question using readly "Regarding this text from the PDF:
"Meal 1 – Breakfast (~400 kcal | ~50g protein"" it showes me this error and didn't reply.
