-----------------------------------------------------------

- just for reployment!

- code is not in style and able to copy in messages. 


- 'virtual-scrolling-chat' branch has good progress

- Aug 6 morning build with comment "fixed build errors" was working fine before pdf optimisation

- page count is showing 1 page in DB. 

- left side bar list is not updating because of cache and many times it start loading. it shouldn't load after few change between pdf. 

- if one user is access another user pdf we'll show some other message.

- no message before summary first we'll send summary otherwise sometimes user asking about summary before DB saved all the chunks and this is creating trouble! 

- chat again loading from start and scrolling to down!  >> DONE

- pdf is not uploading from live website if not there in local webiste. 

- highlights sometimes working only on top and bottom line!

- difference between message gone! and 1st message shouldn't run any animation, opacity animation is running while sending message also. infact it's running that time only not on load. >> DONE

- on deleting text it's working but also showing some error need to fix that. 

- when i asked this question using readly "Regarding this text from the PDF:
"Meal 1 – Breakfast (~400 kcal | ~50g protein"" it showes me this error and didn't reply.

-- make comment opening z-index bigger and text!!


16 aug Todo:

-- flow chat can be better than mind mapping. 
-- upload should work on domain
-- ask question via image. add image to ask input field. 
-- shapes
-- domain purchase and connect!
-- use links to upload doc. 
-- id and pass not working! 

-- we'll run out caching for recent used pdf in every 24 hours. 


before launch focus on this. 

DONE -- upload doc via main domain, working --- but url on domain is not working! 
-- subscription should work
DONE -- i'm able to upload doc using url but chunks are not being sent to DB from main domain and no summarisation working. 
DONE -- ⁠sound can play in my website. 
•⁠  ⁠⁠model switch
•⁠  ⁠⁠upgrade card if hit any limit
DONE -- allow home page access to free users -- create home page.
-- comment all console log
DONE -- option where user can listen the text, add input in speaking way. 
DONE -- in brush tool drawings are not scaling properly.
DONE -- screenshot asking! 
DONE -- some spin animation when generating answers. **
DONE -- change in page not working properly, unloaded pages are not in good shape for sure. **important**
DONE -- we have to main point-even: none or auto -- i'll do in the morning! 
DONE -- scale issue of shapes. they will change their scale with scale in pdf. 
-- deselect shapes when pressing on normal area. 
-- add NOTES: functionality! 
-- first load of chat is slow, is there any queue or something that chat for first time is loading slow? only first chat after reload, then on swithching chats are loading good. 




solution 

📝 Why It's Failing:

  The citation regex pattern in your code is:
  const citationPattern = /\[cite:(\d+):([^\]]+)\]/g;

  This pattern expects:
  - \d+ = Only pure numbers (like 45, 18, 10)

  But the second message has:
  - Page6, Page18, Page10 = Text + numbers

  The regex \d+ matches only digits, so it fails to match Page6 because "Page" contains letters.

  🤔 What's Happening:

  1. First message: [cite:45:...] → \d+ matches 45 ✅
  2. Second message: [cite:Page6:...] → \d+ cannot match Page6 ❌

  The TextWithCitations component finds no matches in the second message, so it just returns the raw
   text without processing.

  💡 The Fix Would Be:

  Change the regex from (\d+) to ([^:]+) to match any characters (not just numbers):
  const citationPattern = /\[cite:([^:]+):([^\]]+)\]/g;

  This would match both 45 and Page6 formats.

  Root Cause: Your LLM is generating inconsistent citation formats - sometimes pure numbers,
  sometimes "PageX" format. The regex only handles the pure number format.


  -- home page design 
  -- model swithching
  -- subscription should working
  DONE -- search bar for pdf 
  -- keep the signed URL for 24hours?
  -- font family for some headings!!
  DONE -- not counting page for url upload, even free user is able to upload big docs
  -- make some pdf star
  -- make some UI in chat panel while we are processing batches. 
  -- cancel in subscription not canceling in dodo payments.
  -- prorated pricing. 


  -- when someone change pdf we'll reset search functionality. 

  later stage. 

  -- MCQs and flashcards as per page

-- semantic vector search try for once. 


 -- 1. Clear any existing chunks with embeddings (since they're in wrong format)
  DELETE FROM "pdf_chunk" WHERE "embedding" IS NOT NULL;

  -- 2. Drop the embedding column and recreate it with proper vector type
  ALTER TABLE "pdf_chunk" DROP COLUMN "embedding";
  ALTER TABLE "pdf_chunk" ADD COLUMN "embedding" vector(1536);

  -- 3. Add vector index for performance
  CREATE INDEX pdf_chunk_embedding_cosine_idx
  ON "pdf_chunk"
  USING ivfflat ("embedding" vector_cosine_ops)
  WITH (lists = 100);

  -- 4. Mark PDFs as not extracted so they can be re-processed
  UPDATE "pdf" SET "textExtracted" = false WHERE "textExtracted" = true;
